# Family tree Analytics 
This project was primarily attempted to integrate our learning experiences in Data Structures and Algorithms with real-world applications. It is a python based solution for creation and visualisation of family tree. It uses Graphviz to display the family tree created in a .png format. It makes use of python’s data manipulation. The project helps in preserving one’s family tree using pickle module in python hence the user can access their family tree as and when required even after exiting and reopening the program. The design is done in python using a graph data structure involving representing individuals as nodes in a graph and familial relationships as edges. Each person has attributes including as name and age. The functionalities include adding, deleting and editing both family memebers and familial relationships. It also includes additional commands for displaying the tree both via script and visual formats and finding relatives of a given family member. For depiction of the tree using Graphviz, a DOT text file describes the nodes and edges of the graph. The shape attribute is used to represent the shape of the nodes in the damily tree. I worked primarily on the depiction of the family tree using Graphviz.
